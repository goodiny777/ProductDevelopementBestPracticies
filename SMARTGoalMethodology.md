# SMART Goals: Making Goals Meaningful

This guide helps you understand how to define and create measurable project goals using the SMART methodology. SMART goals are crucial for ensuring project success. Even if you don't directly set project goals in your early career, understanding and clarifying them using this framework is a valuable skill. SMART goals help visualize the full scope of a goal, assess its feasibility, and define project success in concrete terms.

## Understanding SMART Criteria

The SMART acronym stands for:

* **S**pecific: The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret.
* **M**easurable: Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.
* **A**ttainable: The project team agrees the objective is realistic.
* **R**elevant: The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.
* **T**ime-bound: The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.

*(You may encounter variations on what each letter in the “SMART” acronym stands for. For example, you might see “Actionable” or “Achievable” instead of “Attainable,” or “Realistic” instead of “Relevant.” However, the general intent of each term—to ensure the goal is well-defined and within reach—remains consistent.)*

## Focusing on the "M" in SMART: Measurable Goals

Let’s take a moment to zoom in on the **M** in SMART, which stands for **Measurable**. Having measurable goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. Measurable goals are important because they leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders.

Not every metric will have value, so you will have to determine which metrics make sense for the project.

**Example:**
Measuring how many meetings the software engineers on your project attend on a weekly basis may not be the most valuable metric for a productivity goal. Alternatively, you might measure other aspects of the engineers’ productivity, such as:
* A particular number of features created per engineer.
* A specific number of issues flagged or resolved per day.

## Defining a SMART Goal: An Example

Let’s explore an example related to making a personal goal measurable and SMART.

Imagine you are looking to make a career change, and you set a general goal: "Complete a Google Career Certificate."

Here's how to make it SMART:

* **Specific:** The goal is to attain a Google Career Certificate. This is clear.
* **Measurable:** Success is measured by receiving the certificate upon completion of the entire program—a tangible outcome.
* **Attainable:** You can make this goal attainable by deciding to complete one course per month. This breaks down the larger goal into manageable steps.
* **Relevant:** This goal is relevant because it directly supports your desire to make a career change and acquire new skills.
* **Time-bound:** You can make this goal time-bound by deciding to complete the program within six months.

After defining each of these components, your SMART goal becomes:

> **"Obtain a Google Career Certificate by taking one course per month to complete the program within the next six months."**

## Key Takeaway

Determining metrics can be extremely helpful in capturing statuses, successes, delays, and more in a project. As a project manager, identifying meaningful metrics can help move the project toward its goal. Additionally, by defining each element of a project goal to make it SMART, you can determine what success means for that goal and how to achieve it.
