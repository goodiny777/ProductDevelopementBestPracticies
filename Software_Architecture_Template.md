# Software Architecture & Design Documentation Guidelines

Use this template when creating documentation for a new feature, system, or significant changes. Ensure clarity and comprehensiveness so both human team members and AI agents can easily understand and execute the task.

---

## PART 1: Defining Your Problem

Clearly define and scope the issue or feature you're addressing.

### Problem Description

* **What specific problem are you solving?**
* **Why is this problem important?** (Explain the impact or context)

### Input Data

* **What input data will the system use?**
* **Where and how is the input data sourced?**
* **What is the format and structure of this data?**

### Solution Overview

* **How will the solution approach solving the problem?** (Briefly explain your strategy)
* **What actions will your program or feature perform?**

### Expected Outputs

* **What outputs/results will your program generate?**
* **What is the expected format of these results?**

### End Product & User Guidance

* **What is the final deliverable or product?**
* **What instructions or guidelines should be provided to the end-user?**

### Additional Context for AI

* **Clearly define any domain-specific terms or concepts.**
* **Explicitly state any assumptions or constraints.**
* **Describe clearly the desired behavior or success criteria.**

## PART 2: Generalizing Into Pseudocode & Algorithm

Provide a structured outline of your solution.

### Pseudocode

* **Write detailed pseudocode representing the logic of your solution.**

### Algorithm

* **Describe the algorithm or method used clearly, step by step.**
* **Include diagrams or flowcharts if possible.**

### DataBase Design & Data Structures
* **Outline the database schema or structure if applicable.**
* **Describe the data structures used in your solution.**

### Specific Examples & Scenarios

* **Provide concrete examples or scenarios demonstrating how the solution should behave.**

### Additional Context for AI

* **Include decision-making criteria and edge cases explicitly.**
* **Clarify iterations, loops, or conditional logic in detail.**

---

## PART 3: Testing

Outline your testing approach comprehensively.

### Testing Plan

* **How will you verify the correctness of your solution?**
* **List key functionalities or areas that must be tested.**

### Testing Strategy

* **Describe the testing methods (unit tests, integration tests, etc.).**
* **How will you handle edge cases and error conditions?**

### Tools

* **Specify which tools/frameworks will be used for testing.**
* **Explain the rationale behind choosing these tools.**

### Test Cases

* **List explicit test cases, including inputs and expected outputs.**
* **Include cases for typical scenarios, boundary conditions, and edge cases.**

### Additional Context for AI

* **Provide guidelines for how the AI should interpret test outcomes.**
* **Clearly document any thresholds or criteria for pass/fail conditions.**

## AI Integration Instructions

Include this section clearly at the end of each documentation file to assist AI agents.

```
AI SYSTEM PROMPT:
Your role Sineor Software developer is to interpret and implement the described feature according to the documentation provided. Carefully adhere to all specified requirements, logic, and testing criteria outlined in this document. Always seek clarification if ambiguity arises.
```

### Recommendations for Clear AI Understanding

* Use simple and precise language.
* Explicitly define all inputs, outputs, conditions, and constraints.
* Clearly document assumptions and anticipated variations in behavior.
* Avoid ambiguityâ€”clarify potential points of confusion proactively.
