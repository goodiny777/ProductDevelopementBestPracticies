# Project Estimation Practice: The Three-Point Technique

Estimating is a crucial aspect of project management. Project managers are expected to accurately estimate essential elements of the project, such as costs, scope, and time. The **three-point estimating technique** is a simple yet powerful method for determining a realistic time estimate for any given task. It counters estimation bias by factoring in the "best-case," "worst-case," and "most-likely" scenarios.

## The Three Points of Estimation

In this technique, each task is assigned three distinct estimates.


* **Optimistic (o):** This is the "best-case scenario" estimate. It assumes everything goes perfectly, with no delays or issues.
* **Most Likely (m):** This is the most realistic estimate based on typical conditions and historical data. It assumes a normal number of challenges might occur.
* **Pessimistic (p):** This is the "worst-case scenario" estimate. It assumes significant problems will arise, based on all potential risks.

For example, when estimating a task, you might consider the following conditions:

| Estimate Type | Conditions Considered | Example Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Optimistic** | Vendor is well-qualified and on time; all staff are present for training; all equipment works perfectly. | 4 Hours |
| **Most Likely** | Vendor is qualified but might face minor material delays; some staff may need rescheduling; minor glitches with equipment. | 6 Hours |
| **Pessimistic**| Original vendor quits and a new one must be found; significant staff turnover; equipment is delivered late or is faulty. | 6 Days |

## Calculating the Final Estimate (E)

Once you have your three estimates (o, m, p), you can calculate a final, more accurate estimate (E) to use in your project plan. Two popular formulas are used for this.

### Triangular Distribution

This formula gives equal weight to all three estimates. It's a simple average of the three points.

$E = \frac{o + m + p}{3}$

This method is straightforward but doesn't give extra consideration to the "most likely" outcome.


**Example:**
* Optimistic (o) = 4 hours
* Most Likely (m) = 8 hours
* Pessimistic (p) = 16 hours

$E = \frac{4 + 8 + 16}{3} = \frac{28}{3} \approx 9.3 \text{ hours}$

### Beta (PERT) Distribution

The Beta distribution, often used in Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT), is a **weighted average**. It gives four times more weight to the "most likely" estimate, making it statistically more accurate in most project scenarios.

$E = \frac{o + 4m + p}{6}$

The added weight on the most likely estimate acknowledges that this outcome is, by definition, more probable.

**Example (using the same values):**
* Optimistic (o) = 4 hours
* Most Likely (m) = 8 hours
* Pessimistic (p) = 16 hours

$E = \frac{4 + (4 \times 8) + 16}{6} = \frac{4 + 32 + 16}{6} = \frac{52}{6} \approx 8.7 \text{ hours}$

As you can see, the Beta (PERT) estimate is pulled closer to the "most likely" value.
