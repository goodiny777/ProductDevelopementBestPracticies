A Project Manager's Guide to Risk Management
1. Understanding and Identifying Risks
Effective risk management begins with understanding what a risk is and identifying its root causes.

Defining Risk vs. Issue
It's crucial to distinguish between a risk and an issue:

Risk: A potential, uncertain event that, if it occurs, could impact a project in the future (positively or negatively).

Issue: A known problem or event that is currently impacting the project or has already occurred.

Root Cause Analysis: The Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)
To understand a risk fully, you must find its root cause. A fishbone diagram is an excellent tool for visualizing the potential causes of a problem.

The steps to create one are:

Define the Problem: Write the main problem or risk effect in a box on the right-hand side (the "head" of the fish).

Identify the Categories: Draw a horizontal line from the box (the "spine"). Branching off this spine, draw lines for major cause categories (e.g., People, Processes, Tools, Materials, Environment, Management).

Brainstorm the Causes: For each category, brainstorm potential causes of the problem and add them as smaller "bones" branching off the main category lines.

Analyze the Causes: Analyze the completed diagram to identify the most likely root causes of the problem, which can then be addressed.

Visual Scheme:

                      Cause 1
                     /
    Category 1 -----<--Cause 2      Category 3
        |            \              /
        |             Cause 3      /
        +--------------------------+----------------> [Problem/Risk Effect]
        |                          |
    Category 2 -----<--Cause 1      Category 4
                     \              \
                      Cause 2        Cause 1

2. Managing High-Impact Risks
Once risks are identified, they must be prioritized. Special attention should be given to those with the highest potential impact on the project.

Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
A Single Point of Failure is a risk that, if it materializes, could cause significant disruption or even shut down the entire project. You should plan for these risks early on.

Example: Having only one Subject Matter Expert (SME) familiar with a critical system on your team is a SPOF. If that SME leaves or becomes unavailable, there is no one else to provide the necessary guidance.

Risk Mitigation Strategies
For high-impact risks like SPOFs, you can rely on four key strategies to manage them.

Case Study: Imagine your project relies on special plant seeds from a single supplier in South America. A new export tax in that country suddenly makes the seeds prohibitively expensive. This is a SPOF.

Hereâ€™s how the four strategies could be applied:

1. Avoid
This strategy seeks to sidestep the risk entirely.

Office Green Example: The team could avoid this risk by choosing to use a different type of seed that is widely available from multiple locations, completely removing the dependency on the South American supplier.

2. Minimize (or Mitigate)
This strategy involves trying to reduce the potential impact of the risk. These are often called "workarounds."

Office Green Example: To minimize the risk, the team could decide to use both the original South American supplier and a new supplier from a neighboring country. This provides flexibility and reduces the impact if one supplier fails.

3. Transfer
This strategy shifts the responsibility of handling the risk to a third party.

Office Green Example: The team could transfer the risk by finding a North American distributor that sources seeds from multiple South American countries. The responsibility for navigating the various taxes and regulations is now on the distributor, not the project team.

4. Accept
This involves acknowledging the risk and not taking any action to prevent it, often because the cost of mitigation outweighs the cost of the risk itself.

Active Acceptance: Setting aside extra funds or time (a contingency reserve) to deal with the risk if it occurs.

Passive Acceptance: Doing nothing and dealing with the consequences if they happen. This is not recommended for high-impact risks.

Office Green Example: The team could actively accept the risk by getting stakeholder approval to budget extra funds to cover the new tax or source seeds from a more expensive supplier if necessary.

3. Understanding Risks from Task Dependencies
Dependencies are relationships where one task's start or finish is reliant on another's. They are a common source of scheduling risk.

Types of Task Dependencies
Finish to Start (FS): The most common type. Task A must finish before Task B can begin.

Example: You must finish putting on your socks (Task A) -> before you can start putting on your shoes (Task B).

Finish to Finish (FF): Task A must finish before Task B can finish.

Example: You must finish making the cake icing (Task A) -> before you can finish decorating the cake (Task B).

Start to Start (SS): Task A must start before Task B can start. The tasks often run in parallel.

Example: You must start paying for a train ride (Task A) -> before you can start boarding the train (Task B).

Start to Finish (SF): The least common type. Task A must start before Task B can finish.

Example: A coworker must start their shift (Task A) -> before your friend can finish their shift (Task B).

Dependency Graphs
A dependency graph visually represents the flow of work and the relationships between tasks, helping to identify potential bottlenecks and risks.

Example: Making a Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich

Activity A: Gather Materials (Bread, PB, Jelly, Knife)

Relationship: Starts the process.

Activity B: Put jelly on one slice of bread.

Relationship: After A (FS).

Activity C: Put peanut butter on the other slice of bread.

Relationship: After A (FS).

Activity D: Put both slices of bread together.

Relationship: After B and C (FS).

Activity E: Serve the sandwich.

Relationship: After D (FS).

This simple graph shows that Tasks B and C can happen in parallel, but both must be complete before Task D can start. A delay in either B or C will delay the rest of the project.

    * Review the main tasks and identify the likely dependencies between them (Finish-to-Start, Start-to-Start, etc.).
    * Point out any potential risks or bottlenecks that arise from these dependencies (e.g., "A delay in Task X will critically impact Task Y").

* **Risk Identification & Root Cause Analysis:**
    * Brainstorm a list of 5-7 potential risks for this project.
    * For the top 2-3 most significant risks, perform a brief root cause analysis (similar to a fishbone diagram approach) by suggesting potential causes from categories like People, Process, Technology, and External Factors.

* **Single Point of Failure (SPOF) Identification:**
    * Analyze the project context and identify any potential Single Points of Failure (e.g., reliance on a single person's expertise, a single supplier, a single piece of technology).

* **Mitigation Strategy Recommendations:**
    * For each of the most significant risks and SPOFs identified, propose a primary mitigation strategy.
    * Classify each strategy as **Avoid, Minimize, Transfer, or Accept**, and briefly explain your reasoning.
