This document is a summarized version of the 2020 Scrum Guide, retaining its essential message and all key terminology.

### Scrum Definition & Theory

**Scrum** is a lightweight framework designed to help people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. It is founded on **empiricism** (knowledge from experience) and **lean thinking** (reducing waste).

Scrum's effectiveness is based on three core pillars:
* **Transparency**: The process and work must be visible to those performing it and those receiving it.
* **Inspection**: Scrum artifacts and progress toward goals must be frequently inspected to detect variances or problems.
* **Adaptation**: If inspection reveals issues, the process or product must be adjusted as soon as possible.

### Scrum Values

The successful application of Scrum is driven by five values:
* **Commitment**: The team commits to achieving its goals and supporting each other.
* **Focus**: The primary focus is on the Sprint's work to make the best possible progress.
* **Openness**: The team and its stakeholders are open about the work and challenges.
* **Respect**: Team members respect each other as capable, independent individuals.
* **Courage**: The team has the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.

### The Scrum Team

The fundamental unit of Scrum is the **Scrum Team**, a self-managing and cross-functional group of 10 or fewer people. It includes three specific accountabilities:

* **Product Owner**: Accountable for maximizing the value of the product by managing the **Product Backlog**. They define the **Product Goal**.
* **Developers**: The people committed to creating any aspect of a usable **Increment** each Sprint.
* **Scrum Master**: Accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide and for the team's effectiveness. They are true leaders who serve the team and the larger organization.

### Scrum Events

All work in Scrum happens within **Sprints**, which are fixed-length events of one month or less. The Sprint is a container for all other events:

* **Sprint Planning**: Initiates the Sprint by creating a plan. It answers:
    1.  *Why* is this Sprint valuable? (Defines the **Sprint Goal**)
    2.  *What* can be Done this Sprint? (Selects items from the Product Backlog)
    3.  *How* will the chosen work get done?
* **Daily Scrum**: A 15-minute daily event for the Developers to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the **Sprint Backlog**.
* **Sprint Review**: Held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the outcome (**Increment**) and adapt the Product Backlog with stakeholders.
* **Sprint Retrospective**: Concludes the Sprint. The team inspects how the last Sprint went and plans ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

### Scrum Artifacts

Scrum's artifacts represent work or value and are designed to maximize transparency. Each artifact has a corresponding commitment.

* **Product Backlog**: An emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product.
    * **Commitment: Product Goal**: Describes a future state of the product; a long-term objective for the Scrum Team.
* **Sprint Backlog**: A plan by and for the Developers, composed of the **Sprint Goal** (the *why*), the selected Product Backlog items (the *what*), and the plan for delivery (the *how*).
    * **Commitment: Sprint Goal**: The single objective for the Sprint.
* **Increment**: A concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. It is the sum of all completed Product Backlog items during a Sprint and must be in a usable condition.
    * **Commitment: Definition of Done**: A formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product. Work cannot be considered part
